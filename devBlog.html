        <br> Dev Blog- 09/03/2023 </br>
<br> As soon as I began to contend with the net/web art content I think one thing that immediately stood out for me was how it harked my thinking back to Marshall McLuhan’s sentiment, “The Medium Is The Message”. More specifically it brought me back to how the internet as a medium is in itself the actual artwork (message) that is made up of smaller artworks (messages). At least this is how I interpreted it. </br>
<br> The revision videos although on the more lengthier side, were the most valuable part of this week’s work I’d say. I think the way in which Mike elucidates difficult concepts was the first and most invaluable part of the videos, the second was just how in-depth the videos were. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that JavaScript is what is known as a dynamic scripting language, something that despite watching dozens of videos regarding Js I had not once encountered. I think one other thing the videos were very good at was the pacing. The information was not completely overloaded on you and instead gradually increases in difficulty. This was especially true in the 7 JavaScript Fundamentals video. Another very small but helpful aspect of these videos is that they are freely available on the Internet and you can come back to them whenever you’d like. Even if you aren’t a Wits student. </br>
<br> In terms of my own work, I have to settle on a definitive net art piece, however, one of the pieces that has always fascinated me, and is something of a niche internet relic is 973-eht-namuh-973.com. Now due to the obvious cryptic and odd nature of the site I by no means plan on shaping my site on this however I do think in terms of the route I want to take it is invaluable as I am planning on doing something of a surreal Black Mirror-esque site that hopefully doubles down as an intelligent critique on web surveillance and Big Brother.</br>
<br> I enjoyed the readings, it was very interesting to see just how in-depth the rabbit hole of what can be considered web art actually goes. I also found a rather fascinating video that explores some of the earliest examples of web art and explores various pieces from around the world that functioned as the precursors to modern-day net art(post-internet art). Attached below is the video.</br>

<br>Closing thoughts, I think going forward I would like to take a much more experimental route in terms of creating my web page and explore the themes of mass surveillance in a more nuanced way while still having it come through in the design and functionality of my site. </br>
