        <br> Dev Blog- 22/03/2023 </br>
        <br>Conscious, I want to tackle the themes of mass surveillance, net bias & maybe even the invasion of privacy in the digital space. I am interested in how these negative features of the internet have been able to progressively get worse over time, and how we as users contend with these aspects. I am planning on having a website that is almost voyeuristic, in the sense that it slowly tries to gain more pieces of the user’s information so that it can send targeted ads.</br>
<br>The idea is that when the user first boots up the site they will be greeted by a message that claims that the site ‘wishes to be friends’ and initially the user will only be able to scroll down, however as they do they will encounter a question such as “What is your favourite colour?” followed by a set of colours , upon the selection the user will then be taken to the next page where here the colour they chose will be the colour of the page. Then again the site will pose a question now more personal, “Do you live alone?”, answering this takes the user to a new page that has homeware items. The site then poses another question even more personal, “What is your sexual orientation?”.</br>
<br> Alternatively, a much more darker idea would be exploring how the internet has become gentrified and using the site as a means of illustrating that by asking personal questions that almost stereotype the user and even restrict their access to certain pages on the site.</br>
<br>Research:</br>

<br>I really gave much more consideration into how I could make my website a surrealist post-internet nightmare one of the ways I think that could be accomplished is by using that “ugly” early internet set of design principles, the ones that by today’s standards look much older than two decades. I think there is a certain pull to them it’s that feeling wherein you are simultaneously repulsed but also intrigued and fascinated by what you are looking at.</br>
 
<br> I think the Black Mirror idea of having the site “learn” from the user isn’t a new concept by any means but I think having a site that is almost passive-aggressive in trying to get information out of its users without their knowledge is something we can all relate to on at least one level.</br>
<br> Having the internet as a medium for any art also radically changes how we perceive and consume said art, another aspect I’d like to critique is the whole mass consumerism culture, and hopefully, I am smart enough to pull it off, if not I think the self-aware site idea is what I am placing my bets on.</br>
<br> At the moment my biggest difficulty is finding sites that best encapsulate the feeling I am going for, and searching “sites that are watching me” does not help at all. So I think I am stumped for inspiration and really the only thing I have in mind is a site that reads the user their personal information that can be accessed on the computer, and even that I am not entirely sure if that’s possible or ethically sound, let alone legal.</br>
 
<br> In conclusion, I think going forward one of my biggest challenges is getting around how best I can turn what I have on paper into something practical, and the first step is finding similar sites or at least sites that I can pull inspiration from, although this story does have a slight happy ending in that I found this really cool website that has links to other even cooler websites. </br>
